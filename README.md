# Project Name
Deep-Expected-Sarsa

## Description
A deep-expected Sarsa algorithm which was created for a university project. 
It runs in the gym environment, using the Breakout Atari game.
The algorithm was created based on a PyTorch tutorial (credited down below) where the Q-learning update method was changed to the Sarsa update method which resulted in a significant performance increase.

## Files
The deep_expected_sarsa.py trains the model and is able to save it for later. The env_test.py file displays the game so the performance can be observed with the naked eye.

## Installation
To run the project python 3.11 should be used. It should be working fine after cloning the repository and installing the required libraries.

## Credits
The algorithm was created based on the following tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html.
